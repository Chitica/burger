# burger
Burger app that allows user to select a burger name and then 'devour' it. I intended to use Sequelize ORM rather than raw MySQL queries.


# How to use

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, which then you can click to devour.

Each burger in the waiting area will also have a devour button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
